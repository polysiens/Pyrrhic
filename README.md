Pyrrhic is an experimental project developed to test few features.
Main feature was to test how it would feel to have the camera attached to the head bone and actually rotate the head and neck instead of the camera component.
Secondary was testing game feature modularity and modular animation blueprints.

Takeaways:
  1. The head rotation and character control was interesting. I can see more polished version of it being fun to learn to play.
  2. Game Feature plugin is really powerful and more structured project can benefit a lot from it. There are some things that I would change now that I am more familiar with it(like game modes having to be listed in project settings).
  3. Animation Blueprint modularity is possible, but would have to be researched and developed further.
